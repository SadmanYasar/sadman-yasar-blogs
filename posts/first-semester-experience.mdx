title: 'First Semester Experience At UTM'

After 3 months of waiting, I finally attended my first lecture at UTM. Even though the classes started at 8am MYT, I had to wake up at 6am due to time zone difference. You may wonder why time zone can be an issue if my university is in Malaysia. Well, the whole semester was in online mode due to the pandemic and travel restrictions. It was not so difficult to adapt, after all, as during my gap year after finishing my ALevels, I was an online math tutor for OLevels.
<br />
As time went by, I got to meet students from many different countries like UK, Egypt, Yemen, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, China and of course, Malaysia. We worked together in group projects, prepared slides for presentation, designed an elevator system using Deeds software for our Digital Logic course. I learned to use Matlab in our Linear Algebra course. The language is syntactically similar to Python but the best feature I enjoyed was how easy it is to write matrices and assign it to a variable. For other languages like C++, it can get cumbersome to use multidimentional arrays as matrices. The programming course was the easiest for me as I already knew the concepts that were taught.
<br />
Overall, I will say the experience was great. The professors provided guidance whenever we got stuck in a problem. The students were very friendly and we helped each other by doing group discussions to prepare well for examinations.
<br />
I got my results at the beginning of this August. With a CGPA of 3.89, I am now in the Dean's list. I hope I can keep this result in the next semester.
